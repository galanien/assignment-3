#  Electronic Devices

This project includes a base class for devices and derived classes for specific types of devices like smartphones, laptops, and tablets. The program generates random instances of these devices, calculates total prices, and manages class hierarchies.

## Overview

The project includes the these components:

- A base class `Device` that represents common attributes for all devices.
- Derived classes `Smartphone`, `Laptop`, and `Tablet` that inherit from the `Device` class and include specific attributes and methods for each device type.
- The `DeviceMain` class that contains the main program to interact with the classes, generate random instances, and calculate the required information.

## How to Compile and Run

To compile and run the code, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Compile the code using the following command:


## Additional Information

- The program utilizes the `Random` class to generate random values for prices, weights, and specific attributes of the devices.
- It demonstrates the use of inheritance in Java to create a class hierarchy for different types of devices.
- The program calculates the total price and total weight of all devices and displays the results.
